# Name-Creator
This Neural Network produces names from an existing dataset of names by having a certain amount of context of previous charcaters to predict the next character. It is coded from scratch and only utilizes tensors for numerical storage. Otherwise, everything was done bare bones and althought it will not perform as good as calling an MLP and feeding it the data, it is good and necessary practice. I then implemented a simple wavenet version of it so I can improve the model slightly.
